\title{
Plot \code{BAMM}-estimated macroevolutionary rates on a phylogeny
}
\description{
\code{plot.bammdata} plots a phylogenetic tree from a \code{bammdata} object and
colors each branch by the estimated rate of speciation, extinction, or trait evolution. Rates are not assumed to be constant in time, and the function can plot continuously-varying rates along individual branches. 
}

  \item{tau}{
a numeric indicating the grain size for the calculations. See documentation for \code{dtRates}.  	
}
  \item{method}{

terminal nodes. Ignored if \code{method = "phylogram"}.

}
\item{breaksmethod}{
	method used for determining color breaks. See help file for \code{\link{assignColorBreaks}}.

\details{
To calculate rates, each branch of the phylogeny is discretized into a number of small segments, 
and the mean of the marginal posterior density of the rate of speciation/extinction or trait evolution is 
calculated for each such segment. Rates are mapped to colors such that cool colors represent 
slow rates and warm colors represent fast rates. When the tree is
plotted each of these small segments is plotted so that changes in rates through time and shifts in 
rates are visible as gradients of color. The \code{spex} argument determines the type of rate that will
be calculated. \code{spex = "s"} will plot speciation rates, \code{spex = "e"} will plot extinction rates,
and \code{spex = "netdiv"} will plot diversification rates (speciation - extinction). Note that if \code{x$type = "trait"} the \code{spex} argument is ignored and rates of phenotypic evolution are plotted instead. If \code{legend = TRUE} the function will plot a legend that contains the mapping of colors to numerical values.  

A number of color palettes come built in with BAMMtools. Color-blind friendly options include
\tabular{r}{
\code{BrBG} \cr
\code{PiYG} \cr
\code{PRGn} \cr
\code{PuOr} \cr
\code{RdBu} \cr
\code{RdYlBu} \cr
\code{BuOr} \cr
\code{BuOrRd} \cr
\code{DkRdBu} \cr
\code{BuDkOr} \cr
\code{GnPu} \cr	
}
Some color-blind unfriendly options include
\tabular{r}{
\code{RdYlGn} \cr
\code{Spectral} \cr
\code{temperature} \cr
\code{terrain} \cr
}
For more information about these color palettes visit \code{colorbrewer2.org} and

\code{geography.uoregon.edu/datagraphics/color_scales.htm} 

or use the help files of the R packages \code{RColorBrewer} and \code{dichromat}.

Additionally, any vector of valid named colors may also be used. The only restriction is that the length of this vector be greater than or equal to three (you can provide a single color, but in this case the entire tree will be assigned the same color). The colors should be ordered from cool to warm as the colors will be mapped from low rates to high rates in the order supplied (e.g. \code{pal=c("darkgreen","yellow2","red")}). The option \code{pal = "temperature"} uses the \code{rich.colors} function written by Arni Magnusson for the R package \code{gplots}.

Internally \code{plot.bammdata} checks whether or not rates have been calculated by looking for a component named
"dtrates" in the \code{bammdata} object. If rates have not been calculated \code{plot.bammdata} calls \code{dtRates} with \code{tau}. Specifying smaller values for \code{tau} will result in smoother-looking rate changes on the tree. Note that smaller values of \code{tau} require more computation. If the \code{colorbreaks} argument is \code{NULL} a map of rates to colors is also made by calling \code{assignColorBreaks} with \code{NCOLORS = 64}. A user supplied \code{colorbreaks} argument can be passed as well. This allows one to plot parts of a tree while preserving the map of rates to colors that was made using rates for the entire tree.

If color.interval is defined, then those min and max values override the automatic detection of min and max. This might be useful if some small number of lineages have very high or very low rates, such that the map of colors is being skewed towards these extremes, resulting in other rate variation being drowned out. If specified, the color ramp will be built between these two color.interval values, and the rates outside of the color interval range will be set to the highest and lowest color. 

If \code{plot.bammdata} is called repeatedly with the same \code{bammdata} object, computation can be reduced by first calling \code{dtRates} in the global environment.
}
\value{
Returns (invisibly) a list with three components. 
\item{coords}{
A matrix of plot coordinates. Rows correspond to branches. Columns 1-2 are starting (x,y) coordinates 
of each branch and columns 3-4 are ending (x,y) coordinates of each branch. If \code{method = "polar"} a 
fifth column gives the angle (in radians) of each branch.
}
\item{colorbreaks}{
A vector of percentiles used to group macroevolutionary rates into color bins.	
}
\item{colordens}{
A matrix of the kernel density estimates (column 2) of evolutionary rates (column 1) and the color (column 3) corresponding to each rate value.
