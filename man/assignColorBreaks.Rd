	Map macroevolutionary rates to colors
}
\description{
	Maps macroevolutionary rates to a set of \code{NCOLORS}.
}
\usage{
	assignColorBreaks(rates, NCOLORS = 64, spex = "s", logcolor = FALSE, 
		method = c("linear","quantile","jenks"), JenksSubset = NULL)
}
\arguments{
	\item{rates}{
		a numeric vector of phenotypic rates or a list of numeric vectors of speciation and extinction rates.
	}
	\item{NCOLORS}{
		an integer number of colors to use for the mapping. Larger numbers do not 
		necessarily result in smoother looking color ramps. The default is 64 and 
		is probably sufficient for most purposes.
	}
	\item{spex}{
		a character string. "s" means that speciation rates are used to make the
		map, "e" means that extinction rates are used. "netdiv" means that 
		diversification rates are used. Ignored for BAMM trait data.
	}
	\item{logcolor}{
		should the natural logarithm of rates be used for the color map.
	}
	\item{method}{
		determines how the color breaks are created. See details.
	}
	\item{JenksSubset}{
		Number of regularly spaced samples to subset from \code{rates}. Only relevant when \code{method = "jenks"}. 
		See Details. 
	}
}
\details{
	If \code{method = "quantile"} macroevolutionary rates are binned into \code{NCOLORS+1} percentiles 
	and rates in each bin are mapped to a color determined by the \code{pal} argument in \code{plot.bammdata}. 
	Alternatively, if \code{method = "linear"} macroevolutionary rates are binned into \code{NCOLORS+1} equal 
	length intervals between the minimum and maximum. 
	If \code{method = "jenks"}, macroevolutionary rates are binned into \code{NCOLORS+1} categories, according to 
	the Jenks natural breaks classification method. This method is borrowed from the field of cartography, and 
	seeks to minimize the variance within categories, while maximizing the variance between categories. 

	The Jenks natural breaks method was ported to C from code found in the classInt R package.
